791,"Diotima liep naar de fontein die zelf op een bemoste heuvel naast haar zat en haar discipelen gingen op het gras bij haar in de buurt zitten. Zonder me op te merken die vlak onder haar zat, ging ze verder met haar toespraak toen het een van haar luisteraars overkwam, maar voordat ik probeerde te herhalen haar woorden zal ik de hoofdman beschrijven van wie zij leek vooral te willen imponeren. Een was een vrouw van ongeveer jaren oud in het volle genot van de meest exquise schoonheid haar gouden haar zweefde in krulletjes op haar schouders, haar wazige ogen waren overschaduwd door zware deksels en haar mond de lippen uit elkaar leken zintuiglijk te ademen. Maar ze leek peinzend ongelukkig, haar wang was bleek, ze leek eraan gewend te lijden en alsof de lessen die ze nu hoorde de enige woorden van wijsheid waren waarnaar ze ooit had geluisterd. naast haar had een heel ander aspect, zijn vorm was bijna uitgemergeld tot een schaduw, zijn gelaatstrekken waren knap maar dun, zijn ogen glommen alsof het het gezicht van het verval animeerde zijn voorhoofd was ruim maar er was twijfel in zijn uiterlijk dat leek te zeggen dat hoewel hij wijsheid had gezocht hij verstrikt was geraakt in een aantal mysterieuze doolhoven waarvan hij tevergeefs trachtte zich te bevrijden Toen Diotima sprak, ging zijn kleur met snelle veranderingen de soepele spieren van zijn gelaat toonden elke indruk die zijn geest opving, hij leek iemand die in het leven hard had gestudeerd, maar wiens zwakke frame verzonk onder het gewicht van de loutere inspanning van het leven, de vonk van intelligentie brandde met ongewone kracht in hem maar die van het leven leek ooit aan de vooravond van het vervagen. Op dit moment zal ik geen andere groep beschrijven, maar met diepe aandacht probeer ik enkele van de woorden van Diotima in mijn herinnering te herinneren, het waren woorden van vuur maar hun pad is vaag gemarkeerd op mijn herinnering. Het vereist een rechtse hand, zei dat ze haar verhandeling voortzet, om te wegen, het goede van kwaad verdelen. Op aarde zijn ze onlosmakelijk verstrikt en als je wat zou wegwerpen lijkt een kwaad een veelheid aan gunstige oorzaken of effecten klampen zich eraan aan bespotten je arbeid Toen ik op aarde was en in een eenzaam land wandelde tijdens de stilte van de nacht heb ik de veelheid aan sterren aanschouwd, de zachte uitstraling van de maan weerspiegeld op de zee , die was bezaaid met prachtige eilanden Toen ik voelde dat de zachte bries over mijn wang stak als de woorden van liefde die het heeft gekoesterd, mij koesterde, leek mijn geest bijna te stoppen met het lichaam dat het op de aarde verbond met een snel mentaal gevoel om te mengen met het tafereel dat ik nauwelijks zag, voelde ik. Toen riep ik uit, o wereld hoe mooi je bent, oh helderste universum zie je aanbidder geest van schoonheid van sympathie die alle dingen doordringt, tilt nu mijn ziel op als met vleugels, hoe heb je het licht geanimeerd de briesjes Diep onverklaarbare geest geef me woorden om mijn aanbidding uit te drukken; mijn geest is weggejaagd, maar met taal kan ik niet zeggen hoe ik je schoonheid voel. Stilte of het lied van de nachtegaal de tijdelijke verschijning van een vogel die stilletjes voorbij vliegt lijkt meer geanimeerd met jou dan de hele hemel bezaaid met werelden ""Als de wind brulde scheurde de zee en de vreselijke bliksemschichten leken om mij heen te vallen, nog steeds was liefde vermengd met de heilige angst die ik voelde, de majesteit van schoonheid was diep onder de indruk op mij. Dus ook ik voelde toen ik een prachtig gezicht heb gezien of plechtige muziek hoorde of de welsprekendheid van de goddelijke wijsheid die stroomt van de lippen van een van zijn aanbidders, een lief dier of zelfs de sierlijke golvingen van bomen, levenloze voorwerpen hebben in mij hetzelfde diepe gevoel van liefdesschoonheid opgewekt, een gevoel dat, terwijl het me levend liet verlangen naar het zoeken naar de als animator van de scène, maar toch bevredigde ik me door de diepte ervan alsof ik de oplossing voor mijn vragen al had gevonden alsof ik mezelf als een deel van het grote geheel voelde, had ik de waarheid gevonden ecret van het universum Maar toen ik met pensioen ging in mijn cel die ik had bestudeerd over de verschillende bewegingen en handelingen in de wereld, heeft het gewicht van het kwaad me in de war gebracht. Als ik aan de schepping dacht, zag ik een eeuwige keten van kwaad die met de ander verbonden was vanuit de grote de walvis die in de zee slikt, vernietigt menigten, de kleinere vissen die op hem leven, kwellen hem ook tot waanzin voor de kat wiens plezier het is om haar prooi te pijnigen. Ik zag de hele schepping vervuld van pijn, elk schepsel lijkt te bestaan ​​door de ellende van een andere dood chaos is het wachtwoord van de geanimeerde wereld en de mens is zelfs in Athene de meest geciviliseerde plek op aarde wat een veelheid van gemene hartstochten benijdt, een onrustig verlangen koestert om alles wat groots en goed was, te bezoedelen zag ik En in de heerschappijen van de geweldig wezen zag ik de mens gereduceerd worden?",MWS
