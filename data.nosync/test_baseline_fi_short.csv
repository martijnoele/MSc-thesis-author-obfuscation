One was about a year old woman to enjoy the most beautiful beauty. Her golden hair floated over her shoulders. His bumps eyes were shaded by the heavy lids and the lips of his mouth seemed to be breathing sensitivity But he seemed thoughtful of laughter that his cheeks were pale, seemed to be accustomed to suffering and as the lessons he heard were the only words of wisdom, which he had ever listened to. there was a very different aspect on his side, his shape was almost shaded, his features were handsome but thin, his worn eyes glittering as if animated by the decomposition of his forehead was a wide but undoubtedly embarrassment to his appearance that seemed to say that even though he had sought wisdom, had been involved in some mysterious mazes, which he tried in vain to escape from himself. Diotima talked about her color came quickly with changes her elastic muscles showed her every impression that her mind made her look like she had learned hard in life but whose weak body sunk beneath the weight of life, the spark of intelligence burned within rare power, but in life they seemed to always on the eve of the morning.
